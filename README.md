## Cloning this project in Cloud9

Go to your Cloud9 dashboard and do "Create New Workspace".  
Choose "Clone From URL".  
Enter as the URL: `git@github.com:yaleinteractive/networks-demo.git`

A project called `networks-demo` will be created in your workspace. Edit it. It will have all the files from this GitHub repo.

Alternatively, you can just create an empty new workspace (choose "Custom" as the workspace template).
Create new files for `hello.js` and `clock.js` and just copy and paste the code from GitHub.

This GitHub repo will be updated each week with the code from our class. You can clone it each time to get the latest updates into a new project in your Cloud9 dashboard.

## Running this project

In Cloud9, double click `hello.js` and then click "Run" to see some simple output in the console at the bottom.

Double click `clock.js` and then click "Run" to see some output based on the time, in the console at the bottom.

## Next steps

Modify `clock.js` to make your own output based on the time.

Try using the debugger by inserting a breakpoint in the margin, and clicking "Run".
